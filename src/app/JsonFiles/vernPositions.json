Was responsible for the successful migration of the City U instructional center database to the new Trackhound database format, including the maintenance of the stored procedures and ASP scripts the supported the courseware.  Provided proof of concept prototypes to repurpose the educational content into different forms.  Quickly wrote ASP code and redesigned the database to produce courseware for a clone of the Trackhound database for a major insurance client by finding a method to produce the page without HTML frames.  Then designed the database and produced ASP code to produce a registration site and tools to handle enrollment manage users of the system.  Revised a VB 6.0 application which imports courses and tests into the Trackhound database to embed the tests and glossary within the course file and to provide error checking of the import file.  Also wrote a procedure to export the information out from the database into the import file.",
			"Wrote Three Tier VB 6.0 application that administrates on-line course students and enrollment and performs archival functions for these on-line courses.  System is written using DLLs that interfaces with a SQL Server 7.0 Database and generate middle tier data objects that can interface with any client software.  The system was written to be manipulated by a VB 6.0 client, but could be easily attached to an ASP application.  Within this system, designed and developed an object that translates information from the data objects into a tabular format for use with VB Listview controls, HTML tables, & external flat files.",
			"Designed a SQL Server 7.0 database (Trackhound) that holds the menus and contents for on-line instructional learning courses.  Wrote scripts and stored procedures to transfer a SQL 6.5 one customer On-line Instructional center database into a multi-customer based system using restructured tables with added functionality.   The scripts create all of the Tables and Stored procedures.  The data is then populated from the original data or from the previous build.  Initially the code was written as SQL scripts, but now it has been converted into stored procedures, several which perform system functions, several more which populate the actual tables.  I wrote a VB 6.0 SQL table importer application that uses delimited ASCII files containing the new data, and populate one of three key tables within the new On-Line Instructional center database.  I was able to complete the SQL work in about 75 percent of the time that the customer actually expected me to take",
			"Converted SQL scripts into a VB 6.0 SQL table data migrator system using two database connections, flat ASCII files housing small SQL scripts and execution lists.  The application runs the SQL scripts to create and populate a refined database based on data from an original database.  Code is included that sets the userâ€™s roles and access settings to specific tables within new database.",
			"Wrote ASP for an educational institution On-Line course web site using Advanced HTML, VB Script, and      Java Scripts and completed on very short notice.   Writing ASP applications and tools in support of a on-line educational course management software package that perform data entry and reporting of database contents for an online Discussion Folder (which was converted from Unix based code residing on a LINUX box), enrollment manager, and project task manager database."
